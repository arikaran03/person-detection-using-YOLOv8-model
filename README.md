--- Person Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements a person detection system using the YOLOv8 model, aimed at identifying potential shoplifting activities in retail environments.

## Features

- Real-time person detection in video streams or images
- Utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection model
- Easy integration with surveillance camera feeds
- Outputs bounding boxes and confidence scores for detected persons

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the detection script:
    ```bash
    python detect.py --source path/to/video_or_image
    ```
3. View the output with detected persons highlighted.
